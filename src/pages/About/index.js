        We are a team of 4 members with passion of helping our fellow filpino
        citizens. With stroke being 2nd in mortality rate in the Philippines,
        this inspired us to create a game based exercise made for stroke
        patients with upper extremity ailment. With the help of Licensed
        Physical Therapists we brought UpLigs to life that brings a new way of
        exercising that drives patients with motivation and inspiration.
